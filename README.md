### Game overs
Traveller beware the Fates are watching you, and they're on your side. They will let you retry the level if you're 
clumsy enough to fall or drown, but the monsters are their creations. If you are touched by one of them, you will lose a life 
that each of the Fates gave you at the beginning of your quest. 3 lives for 3 Fates. If you lose these 3 lives, they'll 
think you're not godlike enough and will make you start all over again to prove your true worth. Will you be strong 
enough to survive the journey ?
